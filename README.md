# INFSCI_2595_Fall_2019
## Welcome to INFSCI 2595 - Machine Learning!  
This course provides an overview of popular supervised learning methods, ranging from the fundamental linear model up to ensemble methods.  
In addition, students will be introduced to feature selection, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning topics and methods.

### Week 01
* Supervised learning overview.  
* Introduction to probability and the Bernoulli distribution.  

### Week 02
* The Binomial, Beta, and Gaussian distributions.  
* Beta-binomial model, working with posterior distributions.  
* Normal-normal model, working with log-posterior functions.  

### Week 03
* The Multivariate Normal (MVN) and Multinomial distributions.
* Laplace approximation.  

### Week 04
* Introduction to linear models.
* OLS, MLE, and MAP.
* Laplace approximation, posterior covariance matrix.
* Posterior predictions and uncertainty intervals.
* Linear basis functions and design matrices.

### Week 05
* Regression performance metrics: RMSE, MAE, R-squared.
* Bayesian model selection, complexity, and information criteria.
* Introduction to logistic regression.  

### Week 06
* Bayesian logistic regression.
* Multiple inputs and interactions.
* Confusion matrix.  

### Week 07
* Confusion matrix continued.  
* ROC curve, calibration curve.
